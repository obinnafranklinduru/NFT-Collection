# BinnaDevs Decentralised Application

The BinnaDevs project consists of a smart contract written in Solidity and a frontend application built with Next.js. The smart contract allows users to mint Binna Dev NFTs, while the frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the smart contract.

## Smart Contract - BinnaDevs

The BinnaDevs smart contract is an ERC721 token contract that allows users to mint Binna Dev NFTs during a presale period or after the presale has ended. The contract includes functionality for presale minting, regular minting, pausing the contract, and withdrawing Ether from the contract.

## Frontend - Next.js Application

The frontend application built with Next.js provides a user interface for interacting with the BinnaDevs smart contract. It allows users to connect their web3-enabled wallets (e.g., MetaMask) and perform the following actions:

- View and participate in the presale period.
- Mint Binna Dev NFTs after the presale has ended.
- Pause or unpause the contract (accessible only to the contract owner).
- View the current status of the contract and NFTs.

## Technologies Used

The BinnaDevs project utilizes the following technologies:

- Solidity: The programming language used for writing the smart contract.
- Next.js: A React framework for building the frontend application.
- Web3.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum and smart contracts.
- MetaMask: A browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with Ethereum applications.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the BinnaDevs smart contract and provide the necessary configuration parameters (e.g., baseURI, whitelist contract address).
2. Build and run the frontend application locally or deploy it to a web server.
3. Connect a compatible web3-enabled wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the frontend application.
4. Use the user interface to interact with the BinnaDevs smart contract, including participating in the presale, minting NFTs, and managing the contract state.
